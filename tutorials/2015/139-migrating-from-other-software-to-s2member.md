This article will explain how to migrate to s2Member Pro from another software application, while retaining existing users and their payment information.

_The s2Member plugin contains additional inline documentation that should be reviewed carefully following the steps in this article. See: **Dashboard → s2Member® → Import/Export**._

**There are four sections in this KB article:**

-   [Step 1: Collecting Existing Membership Data](#step1)
-   [Step 2: Formatting Existing Data for Importation](#step2)
-   [Step 3: Importing Membership Data](#step3)
-   [Step 4: Reviewing Your Importated Data](#step4)

Import/Export features are only available as part of the s2Member Pro add-on. If you’re only using the free s2Member Framework, you’ll need to [upgrade to s2Member Pro](http://www.s2member.com/pro/) to follow along.

### Step 1: Collecting existing membership data {#step1}

The first step is to collect the membership data from your existing software. If the software supports exporting the data to CSV (Comma Separated Values), then you can export the data, open the file in a spreadsheet program such as Excel, and then reformat the data for s2Member importation (more on formatting in [Step 2](#step2)). If the other membership software does not export data to CSV, but uses a different export format, you’ll need to convert the existing data to s2Member’s CSV format using software such as Excel. As a last resort, you can also build the import file manually by collecting the necessary data and creating a CSV file. This file can be created as a simple text file and saved with the .csv extension, or you can use a spreadsheet program such as Excel.

#### Minimum Required Data

The minimum required data for s2Member importation is as follows:

-   Username
-   Email Address

However, you’ll want to collect at least three more pieces of information to retain subscription information and define the users level within s2Member:

-   Paid Subscr. ID (this is the subscription ID, e.g., `I-EUAVMMPD04HF`)
-   Paid Subscr. Gateway (the payment gateway associated with this subscription ID, e.g., `paypal`)
-   s2Member Level (e.g., `2` for s2Member Level 2, or `0` for Free Subscriber)

The format of this data is important and you must format the data using the s2Member import format (see [Step 2](#step2)). If you’re building this file manually and you’re only inserting some of the information, be sure to include the blank fields in your CSV file.

### Step 2: Formatting existing data for importation {#step2}

Here’s a basic example of the s2Member import format:

```text
"ID","Username","Password","First Name","Last Name","Display Name","Email"
```

If you fill the ID field, the Import routine will update an account matching the ID you specify (so long as the account ID does _not_ belong to an Administrator, this is for security). When importing new Users/Members, you can leave the ID field empty; don’t remove it, just leave it empty (e.g. `""`). Example: `“”,”Username”,”First Name”,”Last Name”,”Display Name”,”Email”`.

If you fill the Password field, the Password that you specify (in plain text) will be used. Otherwise, a Password will be auto-generated by s2Member. The Password field can also be used with an ID update (to update/change the current Password)—so long as the ID field is also filled, and it matches an account already in the system. If you fill the ID field to update an existing account and the leave the Password field empty; the existing Password, for the account matching the ID you specify, will remain unchanged. Here is an extended example that includes all possible fields for an s2Member import file:

```text
"ID","Username","Password","First Name","Last Name","Display Name","Email","Website","Level[0-9]+ or Role ID","Custom Capabilities","Registration Date ( mm/dd/yyyy )","First Payment Date ( mm/dd/yyyy )","Last Payment Date ( mm/dd/yyyy )","Auto-EOT Date ( mm/dd/yyyy )","Custom Value ( starts w/domain )","Paid Subscr. ID","Paid Subscr. Gateway","Custom Field ID #1","Custom Field Value #1","Custom Field ID #2","Custom Field Value #2", ...
```

When assembling the data, it’s important to leave the empty fields present. For example, using the minimum required data explained in [Step 1](#step1), and including the First Name, Last Name, and Full Name fields; a CSV file that contains three users might look like this:

![](http://cdn.websharks-inc.com/s2member/uploads/spreadsheet-screenshot.png)

```text
"", "johnsmith22", "", "John", "Smith", "John Smith", "john.smith@example.com", "", "2", "", "", "", "", "", "", "I-2342934SSER243", "paypal", "", "", "", ""
"", "janedoe11", "", "Jane", "Doe", "Jane Doe", "jane.doe@example.com", "", "3", "", "", "", "", "", "", "I-2426974EEFR216", "paypal", "", "", "", ""
"", "tombradley84", "", "Tom", "Bradley", "Tom Bradley", "tom.bradley@example.com", "", "0", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""
```

In this example, we have three users along with their subscription information and their s2Member Levels defined. The third user, Tom Bradley, has an s2Member Level of 0 defined, which means that he will be imported as a Free Subscriber. You’ll also notice that Tom doesn’t have any subscription data associated with his account.

Since the Password fields in the above example were left blank, s2Member will automatically generate a password for each of the imported users. However, no emails will be sent during the importation process. You may want to send an email to your members informing them that they must reset their password. You can then point them to `/wp-login.php?action=lostpassword` where they can enter their username or email address and reset their password.

If you’re uncomfortable formatting the import data manually, you can create a sample import file by exporting your existing s2Member information (see: **Dashboard → s2Member® → Import/Export → User/Member Exportation
**). You can download the resulting CSV file and then open it with a spreadsheet program such as Excel. From there, you can insert new rows for each of your existing members and follow the format of the existing data.

### Step 3: Importing Membership Data {#step3}

Once your existing membership data has been formatted in the s2Member import format, navigate to: **Dashboard → s2Member® → Import/Export → User/Member Importation**. From here, you can either copy and paste the formatted data into the import text field or click the "Choose File" button to select the CSV file for upload. When you’re ready, click "Import Now".

To ensure the server does not hang-up when importing new users, you are limited to importing 100 users at a time. If you have more than 100 lines to import, please split the file into groups of 100 prior to importing.

_**No Email Notification:** This import routine works silently. Users/Members will NOT be contacted by s2Member; that is, unless you have another plugin installed that conflicts with s2Member’s ability to perform the Import properly. You should always test one or two accounts before importing a large number of Users all at once. If you want Users/Members to be contacted, you can add them manually, by going to **WordPress® → Users → Add New** and selecting one of the s2Member Roles from the drop-down menu._

### Step 4: Reviewing Your Importated Data {#step4}

After you’ve imported the user data, you can verify the import by browsing the users list (see: **Dashboard → Users**) and verify that your users have been imported. If you’ve also imported subscription information (e.g., Paid Subscr. ID and Paid Subscr. Gateway) you’ll need to be sure that you have configured s2Member with the relevant payment gateways. For example, if several imported members included PayPal subscription info, you’d need to ensure that all options have been configured in **Dashboard → s2Member® → PayPal® Options → Account Details**. Also under: **Dashboard → s2Member® → PayPal® Options → PayPal® IPN Integration**. Also under: **Dashboard → s2Member® → PayPal® Options → PayPal® PDT Integration)**. If the gateway(s) have been configured within s2Member, then s2Member will automatically handle cancellations, refunds, and End of Terms (EOTs) for each account when it receives an IPN message from the gateway. (The IPN message will include a reference to the Paid Subscr. ID, which is then matched to the s2Member account.)

#### Automatic EOTs and Account Expirations

How s2Member handles EOT’s is determined by the settings you’ve configured in the Automatic EOT Behavior settings for that gateway (e.g., Dashboard → s2Member® → PayPal® Options → Automatic EOT Behavior). If the exported data from the other software contains expiration dates for each account, you can use the Auto-EOT Date (mm/dd/yyyy) column (see the extended example above) in your import file to specify when the members’ account should expire. 

When that date arrives, s2Member will handle the account according to the Automatic EOT Behavior settings. If you’re importing a user with a running subscription in your payment gateway, keep in mind that s2Member won’t set the EOT time for you when the subscription ends. Notifications from the payment gateway won’t work with s2Member if the subscription was not created through s2Member. You’ll need to manually set an EOT time for the user yourself, either in advance when importing, or later when the subscription ends. New subscriptions created through s2Member won’t have that problem.
