If you find yourself wishing that you could do something more with the `[s2Member-List /]` shortcode, the quickest route to reaching your goal is by using a custom template file of your own.

<div class="li-margins"></div>

1. Make a copy of this default template file: `/s2member-pro/includes/templates/members/member-list.php`

  Place your copy into `/wp-content/member-list.php`
2. Edit `/wp-content/member-list.php` using any custom PHP or WordPress functionality that you like.
