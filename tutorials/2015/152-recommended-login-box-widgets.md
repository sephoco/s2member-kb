## s2MemberÂ® Pro Login Widget

Integrated specifically to meet the needs of s2Member installations; s2Member Pro's Login Widget is specifically designed to work with s2Member (this comes with any purchase of s2Member Pro). It can also be [integrated via PHP](https://github.com/websharks/s2member-kb/issues/148); i.e., you can even embed it into a theme file or another plugin if you like.
