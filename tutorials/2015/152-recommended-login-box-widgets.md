## s2MemberÂ® Pro Login Widget
  Integrated specifically to meet the needs of s2Member installations; s2Member Pro's Login Widget is specifically designed to work with s2Member (this comes with any purchase of s2Member Pro). It can also be [integrated via PHP](http://www.s2member.com/codex/stable/s2member/api_functions/package-functions/#src_doc_s2member_pro_login_widget%28%29); i.e., you can even embed it into a theme file or another plugin if you like.
