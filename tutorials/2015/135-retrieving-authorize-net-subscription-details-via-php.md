If you need to retrieve details about an Authorize.Net subscription using PHP you can use the `c_ws_plugin__s2member_pro_authnet_utilities::authnet_arb_response()` utility function that is provided by s2Member. This will make a request to the Authorize.Net servers.

The following snippet of PHP code demonstrates how to retrieve information about the current user's Authorize.Net subscription. It's a very basic example that takes advantage of s2Member's existing integration with the Authorize.Net API.

_For more information about the underlying API call, see: [ARBGetSubscriptionStatusRequest](http://www.authorize.net/support/ARB_guide.pdf#page=21)_

```php
<?php
// Get the ID of the user currently logged in.
$user_id = get_current_user_id();

// Get the Authorize.Net Subscription ID from the 'Paid Subcr. ID' field on the users account.
$user_subscr_id = get_user_option('s2member_subscr_id', $user_id);

// Build an array with the Authorize.Net request details.
$authnet = array('x_subscription_id' => $user_subscr_id, 'x_method' => 'status');

// Send a request to Authorize.Net to get the details about the subscription.
$authnet = c_ws_plugin__s2member_pro_authnet_utilities::authnet_arb_response($authnet);

// Print everything from the response. This array contains ALL details related to their Authorize.Net Recurring Billing Profile.
print_r($authnet);
?>
```

The code example above does not include any logic for verifying that the current user actually has an Authorize.Net subscription associated with their account. If you implement this example youâ€™ll want to make sure that the current user has an s2Member Role (s2Member Level 0-4+), that they used the Authorize.Net payment gateway, and that `$user_subscr_id` actually contains a value.

## A More Complete Example w/ Conditionals

```php
<?php
if(($user = wp_get_current_user()) && $user->has_cap('access_s2member_level1'))
	if(($user_subscr_id = get_user_option('s2member_subscr_id', $user->ID)))
		if(get_user_option('s2member_subscr_gateway', $user->ID) === 'authnet')
		{
			$authnet = array('x_subscription_id' => $user_subscr_id, 'x_method' => 'status');
			$authnet = c_ws_plugin__s2member_pro_authnet_utilities::authnet_arb_response($authnet);
			print_r($authnet);
		}
```
