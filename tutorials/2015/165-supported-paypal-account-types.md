## PayPal Payments Standard

This is the default payment gateway in the free version of s2Member. We support "Buy Now" and "Subscriptions" (recurring and non-recurring) through PayPal Payments Standard. Available to merchants in [most countries](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/howto_product_matrix/).

## PayPal Website Payments Pro

s2Member Pro adds support for many other payment gateways, and PayPal Pro is included. See: [s2Member Features](http://s2member.com/features/) for more information. See also: [Product Availability](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/howto_product_matrix/) for PayPal's "Website Payments Pro" service. PayPal Pro requires a formal application and a small monthly fee.

Please see: [PayPal Website Payments Pro](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-payments-pro) for full details.

### s2Member Pro Supports two PayPal Pro Flavors

- [PayPal Website Payments Pro](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-payments-pro)
- and [PayPal Website Payments Pro (Payflow Edition)](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/products/ppp-payflow-edition/)

_**Note:** s2Member Pro does **NOT** support Payflow as a stand-alone product. There is a difference. s2Member's support for Payflow is limited to "PayPal Website Payments Pro (Payflow Edition)"; where the Payflow "Edition" of PayPal Pro is now very common in newer PayPal Pro accounts; i.e., if you signup for [PayPal Website Payments Pro](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/paypal-payments-pro) today you will get the Payflow Edition automaticallyâ€”and that's fine!_

_It's the [stand-alone Payflow Payment Gateway](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/payflow-payment-gateway) that we do not support._
