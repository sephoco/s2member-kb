See: **Dashboard ⥱ s2Member Pro ⥱ Pro Coupon Codes**

Coupon codes work together with s2Member Pro Forms. There are detailed instructions provided in the Dashboard under **s2Member Pro ⥱ Pro Coupon Codes**. Don't forget to enable coupon codes in your Pro Form by setting the shortcode attribute `accept_coupons="1"` to indicate that you _do_ accept coupon codes in that particular Pro Form instance.

### So the steps are as follows:

- **Dashboard ⥱ s2Member Pro ⥱ Pro Coupon Codes**; configure one or more Coupon Codes.
- **Dashboard ⥱ s2Member Pro ⥱ [Payment Gateway] Pro Forms**; generate a Pro Form.
- In your Pro Form shortcode, set `accept_coupons="1"` to allow coupon codes to be used there.

### To Existing Users/Customers?

The process is the same. The only difference is related to _which_ type of Pro Form that you generate, and thus _which_ type of Pro Form accepts a coupon code.

To sell an existing customer new access, or allow them to change their existing access; please see: **Dashboard ⥱ s2Member Pro ⥱ [Payment Gateway] Pro Forms ⥱ Billing Modification Forms**. Don't forget to enable coupon codes in your Pro Form by setting the shortcode attribute `accept_coupons="1"` to indicate that you _do_ accept coupon codes in that particular Pro Form instance.
