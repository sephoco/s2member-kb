What you can do is use URI Restrictions.

See: **Dashboard → s2Member (Pro) → Restriction Options → URI Restrictions (typical w/ BuddyPress)**

That will allow you to define specific URIs that certain Membership Levels can access. For example, to require Level 1 to access `/groups/` you would put `/groups/` in the Level 1 field.

If you haven't already, I recommend watching the [BuddyPress + s2Member](http://s2member.com/kb-article/s2member-buddypress/) tutorial video.
