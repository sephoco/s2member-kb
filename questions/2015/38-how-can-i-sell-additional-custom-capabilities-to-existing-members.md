If you want to sell new Custom Capabilities to existing members, you can generate a **Capability (Buy Now)** form that has been configured to add one or more Custom Capabilities to the members' account once they have completed payment for the new Capabilities. See: **Dashboard → s2Member → PayPal Pro-Forms → Custom Capability (Buy Now) Forms**

If you only want existing members to have access to this form, be sure to place the shortcode for the form on a Post or Page that is restricted to existing members. Or, you can wrap your Pro-Form inside [Simple Shortcode Conditionals](http://s2member.com/kb-article/s2if-simple-shortcode-conditionals/).
