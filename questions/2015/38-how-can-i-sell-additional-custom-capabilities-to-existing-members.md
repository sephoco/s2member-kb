If you want to sell new Custom Capabilities to existing members, you can generate a **Capability (Buy Now)** form that has been configured to add one or more Custom Capabilities to the members' account once they have completed payment for the new Capabilities.

If you only want existing members to have access to this form, be sure to place the shortcode for the form on a Post or Page that is restricted to existing members.

See: **Dashboard → s2Member → PayPal Pro-Forms → Custom Capability (Buy Now) Forms**
