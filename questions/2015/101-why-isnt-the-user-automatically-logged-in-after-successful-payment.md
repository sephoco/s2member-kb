s2Member does not automatically log users in after a successful transaction. This is not currently a feature of s2Member.

**However,** if you want to automatically log users in after successful registration (or checkout), there is an MU Plugin you can install to make this work. Please see [Auto-Login Upon Registration](https://github.com/websharks/s2member-kb/issues/166) for more information.
