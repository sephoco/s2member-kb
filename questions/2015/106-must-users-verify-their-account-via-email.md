> Must users verify their account via email?

This depends on your configuration of Registration/Profile Fields in s2Member. Please see: `Dashboard ⥱ s2Member ⥱ General Options ⥱ Registration/Profile Fields` and choose "No" for the option regarding custom passwords.

Choosing "No" causes a password to be sent via email. This means that a user cannot log in to their account unless and until they receive the email with their password.
