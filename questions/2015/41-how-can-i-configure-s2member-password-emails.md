s2Member integrates with WordPress for many things related to user accounts, including the sending of passwords. s2Member itself generally doesn't send password emails--that functionality comes from WordPress itself (see [the one exception] (https://github.com/websharks/s2member-kb/issues/40), where you can customize the New User email). 

If a user resets their password (using the Forgot Password link), for example, that's the [WordPress Password Reset](http://codex.wordpress.org/Resetting_Your_Password) functionality taking care of that. If you want to customize WordPress-related emails, I suggest posting a question on the [WordPress Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/).
