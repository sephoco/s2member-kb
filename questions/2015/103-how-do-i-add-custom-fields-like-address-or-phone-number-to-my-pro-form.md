You can add Custom Registration Fields that show up on the Pro-Forms during checkout and/or when you use the `[s2Member-Profile /]` shortcode (see `s2Member ⥱ General Options ⥱ Member Profile Modifications`) to allow the member to modify their profile. 

The Custom Registration Fields can be anything you want, including address and phone number. Please see `s2Member ⥱ General Options ⥱ Registration/Profile Fields & Options`.
