If you're currently an s2Member Pro customer with a Single-Site License, you can upgrade to an Unlimited-Site license and pay only the difference in the cost. Simply login to your account at s2Member.com, click "My Account" in the menu bar at the top, and then look for the section that says "Upgrade to Unlimited Sites?". There you will find a link where you can upgrade your license at a discount.
