## Troubleshooting Tips

- Are you using the `success=""` attribute in your shortcode?  
  Note: This attribute _requires_ s2Member Pro. See: [Creating a Registration Thank-You Page](https://github.com/websharks/s2member-kb/issues/143)

- Have you verified that the URL you're using in the shortcode attribute leads to a valid, _public_ page (i.e., can you visit that URL when logged out of your WordPress Dashboard?)
