At this time, we do not support on-page credit card processing for the Stripe payment gateway.

The s2Member Pro Stripe payment gateway uses Stripe's JavaScript API, which allows s2Member Pro to make use of the widest range of features provided by Stripe and allows s2Member Pro to automatically make use of any enhancements to the Stripe JavaScript API (i.e., the s2Member software does not need to be updated or changed to make use of new features when Stripe adds those to the JavaScript API).
