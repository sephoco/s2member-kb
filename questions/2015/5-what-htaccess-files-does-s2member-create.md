s2Member creates two `.htaccess` entries. One in the root `.htaccess` file, and the other is actually a separate `.htaccess` file that is specifically for s2Member's File Download functionality; which goes into a directory that is dedicated to that purpose; i.e., `/wp-content/plugins/s2member-files/.htaccess`.

## Root `.htaccess` Entry for Apache

s2Member writes the following entry into the root `.htaccess` file on installation and/or update of the s2Member plugin. It can also occur whenever you save your **s2Member â†’ Download Options**, where s2Member sees that the entry is not there. Currently, the only way to prevent this is to change file permissions on `/wp-config.php`. If it's not writable, s2Member will not attempt to do this.

### Why does s2Member add this entry to my `.htaccess` file?

For a full explanation, please see: [this KB article about GZIP conflicts](http://s2member.com/kb-article/resolving-file-download-problems/)

```apache
# BEGIN s2Member GZIP exclusions
<IfModule rewrite_module>
	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteBase /
	RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} (^|\?|&)s2member_file_download\=.+ [OR]
	RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} (^|\?|&)no-gzip\=1
	RewriteRule .* - [E=no-gzip:1]
</IfModule>
# END s2Member GZIP exclusions
```

## `.htaccess` for Protected Files on Apache

You should have an `.htaccess` file in your `/s2member-files/` directory. If you don't, please re-install s2Member and that will create the proper `.htaccess` file automatically. Either that, or create this file: `/wp-content/plugins/s2member-files/.htaccess` with the following contents...

```apache
<IfModule env_module>
# No GZIP for script-based file downloads.
	SetEnv no-gzip 1
</IfModule>

<IfModule rewrite_module>
# Enable symlinks (required for rewrites).
	Options +FollowSymLinks

# Enable rewrite and configure base.
	RewriteEngine On
	RewriteBase /
