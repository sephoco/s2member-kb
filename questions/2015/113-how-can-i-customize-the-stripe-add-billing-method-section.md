To customize any area of the Pro-Form, you can create a custom Pro-Form Template. See [Customizing Pro-Forms](http://s2member.com/kb-article/s2member-pro-forms/#-customizing-pro-forms). You can also use CSS inside your theme's `style.css` file to override styles specific to the Stripe "Add Billing Method" section.
