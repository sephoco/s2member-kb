Yes, s2Member Pro-Forms (an [s2Member Pro](http://s2member.com/pro/) feature) makes it easy for you to create a list of coupon code configurations for various types of access that you sell. There is no limit to the number of coupon codes that you can create, and they can be applied as flat-rate discounts, percentage-based discounts, to specific Pro Forms on specific Posts/Pages, and you can set them expire automatically on certain dates, and more!

Here is a screenshot of the Pro Coupon Code config. panel in s2Member Pro.

It is also possible to integrate your coupon codes with affiliate tracking software too!
