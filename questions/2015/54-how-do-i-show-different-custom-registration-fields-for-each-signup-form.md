Each Custom Registration Field can be assigned to a specific Membership Level, so that it only shows up on Pro-Forms for that particular Level. For example, if you had one set of Custom Registration Fields that were applicable to Level 1 memberships and another set of Custom Registration Fields that were applicable to Level 2 memberships, you could create your Custom Registration Fields and set the Applicable Level.

See: **Dashboard → s2Member (Pro) → General Options → Registration/Profile Fields & Options → Add New Field**

By default, each Custom Registration Field will appear on Pro-Forms for `all` Membership Levels, but you can customize this as needed. If you want the Custom Registration Field to appear on several Membership Level signup forms you can separate each level with a comma. For example, to show a particular field on Level 1 and Level 3 signup forms, you would enter `1,3` in the Applicable Membership Levels field.
