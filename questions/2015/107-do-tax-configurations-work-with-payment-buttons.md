> Do tax configurations work with payment "buttons"? When I create Paypal buttons for users to add more functionality, the issue is the paypal button does not add/send tax correctly.

In s2Member, the Pro Tax Configuration panel is only for Pro Forms. When it comes to payment "buttons" (e.g. PayPal Buttons; not Pro Forms, ClickBank Buttons, and Google Wallet Buttons), taxes are configured on the payment gateway side—not within s2Member.

## How to Configure Taxes

If you are using Pro Forms, you should configure taxes with s2Member Pro. Taxes can be configured here. Please see: `s2Member ⥱ PayPal Pro-Forms ⥱ Tax Rate Calculations`.

If you are using "buttons", please log into your payment gateway account and configure tax rates there. For instance, in the case of PayPal Buttons, please see: [Setting Up your Tax and Shipping Information for your PayPal Account](https://www.paypal.com/webapps/mpp/get-started/tax-and-shipping)
