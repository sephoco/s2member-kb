## Future PayPal Subscriptions

**Quick Review:** Your customers agree to create a Subscription via PayPal and have that payment recur. With s2Member shortcodes you can customize both the initial amount and all recurring amounts via shortcode attributes (e.g., `ta=""` and `ra=""`). See: **Dashboard → s2Member → PayPal Buttons (or Pro-Forms) → Shortcode Attributes (Explained)**

### Changing the Amount(s) That You Bill

If you decide to change the amount(s) that you bill, you simply change the shortcode attributes in your PayPal Button and/or Pro-Form. Or, you can generate a new shortcode to replace the old one. In this way, you are changing the amount(s) that any NEW customers will be charged; i.e., this does _not_ impact existing customers in any way, which is ideal in most cases.

## Current PayPal Subscriptions

If you already have customers and you want to alter the amount they are charged in each billing cycle, you have two options:

<div class="li-margins"></div>

1. You can log into your PayPal account and alter the Recurring Billing Profiles associated with your existing customers; i.e., change the amount that you charge.
  
  _**Note:** Depending on the type of PayPal account that you have, whether you are raising or lowering the price, and in what dollar amount; there might be limitations imposed by PayPal. If you run into trouble or confusion, please contact PayPal support for assistance._
2. You can lead existing customers to an upgrade and/or downgrade process, which can result in a change in the payment plan and Membershp Level on the site.
