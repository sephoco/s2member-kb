After purchasing s2Member Pro, a new download link will appear in your s2Member Account when you log in at [s2Member.com](http://s2member.com).

Click the download link (indicated by the arrow in the screenshot above) to download s2Member Pro. You can then follow the [installation instructions](http://s2member.com/installation/).

## What if I don't see the new s2Member Pro section?

If you don't see this section when you log in to your account, it could be that your payment is still being processed. The payment gateways sometimes place temporary holds on payments while they verify them. If you don't see the s2Member Pro download link appear in your account within 6 hours, please [contact support](http://s2member.com/support/).
