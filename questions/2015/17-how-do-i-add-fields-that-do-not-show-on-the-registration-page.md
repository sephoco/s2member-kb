> How do I create fields that are in the profile/s2 database, but do not show on the registration form?

This can be accomplished by configuring a Custom Registration/Profile Field with s2Member and modifying the "Allow Profile Edits" option. See: **Dashboard → s2Member → General Options → Registration/Profile Fields & Options**
