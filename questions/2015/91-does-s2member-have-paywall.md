[Wikipedia's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paywall) definition of a paywall is a follows:

> A paywall is a system that prevents Internet users from accessing webpage content without a paid subscription.

With s2Member, you may configure a "Membership Options Page". This can be considered a Paywall. When Users attempt to access restricted content, s2Member will redirect unauthenticated users to the Membership Options Page. All of this is part of s2Member's Security Gate (aka: Paywall).

This page should tell Users about your site's content and show them how to sign up, and usually has an s2Member payment button or Pro Form.
