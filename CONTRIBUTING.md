For Support questions related to s2Member Framework (the free version), please visit the [s2Member Community Forum](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/s2member). If you are an s2Member Pro customer, you can [open a ticket](https://www.websharks-inc.com/support/?product=s2member).

## How can I contribute to the s2Member Knowledge Base?

I'm glad you asked! :-) We'd love help improving our knowledge base and we invite you to leave a comment on any existing KB Article GitHub Issue to share your suggestions for how that article could be improved.

If you'd like to suggest a new KB Article, please open a new GitHub Issue in this repo and share as much information as you can about what question the article should answer. Please be as specific as possible. If you have a real-world example, please feel free to share it! Real-world examples and scenarios make writing a KB Article that much easier. :-)
